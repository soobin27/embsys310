I would like to discuss the Ring security contact sensor.
This sensor detects when a door is open and sends a signal wirelessly to its base station which is connected to the cloud that pushes a notification to the user's app.
It also operates on a battery and is not expected to be recharged more than once a year or so.

The biggest challenge would be the power consumption. As this is a wireless device that also needs to be able to send a signal to the base station, it needs to operate on 
very low current.
