1. Embedded device example
Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents.

I would like to discuss the Ring security contact sensor. This sensor detects when a door or window is open and sends a signal wirelessly to its base station which is connected to the cloud that sends a push a notification to the user's app.
It also operates on a battery and battery is not expected to be changed more than once a year or so.

IoT seems to be enabling a plethora of new cloud connected consumer security devices that help consumers monitor and keep their homes safe. I have a Ring video doorbell device and some wifi cameras that I set up for home security and I believe my home is safer now than before.
I find these security devices very useful and I can see this market growing exponentially for the next 10 years.



- Power consumption. The biggest challenge for this device would be the power consumption. As this is a wireless device, it needs to run on a small battery for atleast a year. Users would not want to replace batteries on their security sensors in their home every month.
- Continuing on the low power challenge would be choosing the best wireless protocol for this device that would satisfy the low power, low cost and small footprint requirements. Choosing the right LPWAN technology would be very important as once it is chosen, it would be very costly to switch to a different wireless protocol.
- To minimize power consumption, one would want to minimize the wireless communication between the security sensor and the base station. 
- Wireless communication is not always reliable. There would need to be a contingency built into the software to ensure that when the sensor senses a change in state, the signal is correctly received by the base station.
- When there is a fault with the security sensor, it needs to alert the base station right away so that user can mitigate the risk accordingly. This being a security device, it is very important that the user is made aware of any failure right away
- Another challenge is the size limit of the sensor. It cannot be too large as it would limit the application for the sensor as users would want something discreet and aethestically pleasing. A large clunky sensor would not be desirable.
